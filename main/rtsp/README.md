# Micro-RTSP

This is a small library which can be used to serve up RTSP streams from
resource constrained MCUs.  It lets you trivially make a $10 open source
RTSP video stream camera.

# Usage

Follow the examples for usage of this library. NOTE: The examples should work with standard Arduino, Platform.io Arduino, Platform.io espidf, and the ESP-IDF directly. It is highly recommended you use the ESP-IDF directly, as it is the most up-to-date and will perform significantly better. Itâ€™s a pain to setup ESP-IDF, but it is well worth it. See the [example esp-idf README](/examples/esp-idf/README.md) for further information.

## Example arduino/ESP32 usage

This library will work standalone, but it is _super_ easy to use if your app is platform.io based.
Just "pio lib install Micro-RTSP" to pull the latest version from their library server.  If you want to use the OV2640
camera support you'll need to be targeting the espressif32 platform in your project.

See the [example platform.io app](/examples/arduino).  It should build and run on virtually any of the $10
ESP32-CAM boards (such as M5CAM) with some modifications. The example is targeted for the AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM.
The relevant bit of the code is included below.  In short:
1. Listen for a TCP connection on the RTSP port with accept()
2. When a connection comes in, create a CRtspSession and OV2640Streamer camera streamer objects.
3. While the connection remains, call session->handleRequests(0) to handle any incoming client requests.
4. Every 100ms or so (10 FPS) call session->broadcastCurrentFrame() to send new frames to any clients.

```
void loop()
{
    // If we have an active client connection, just service that until gone
    if(streamer)
    {
        session->handleRequests(0); // we don't use a timeout here,
        // instead we send only if we have new enough frames

        uint32_t now = millis();
        if((now > (lastFrameTime + msecPerFrame)) || (now < lastFrameTime))
        {
            session->broadcastCurrentFrame(now);
            lastFrameTime = now;
        }

        if(session->m_stopped)
        {
            delete session;
            delete streamer;
            session = NULL;
            streamer = NULL;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        client = rtspServer.accept();

        if(client)
        {
            streamer = new OV2640Streamer(&client, cam);
            session = new CRtspSession(&client, streamer);
        }
    }
}
```
## Example esp-idf usage
Also included is an example using the Espressif IoT Development Framework. See the [example esp-idf README](/examples/esp-idf/README.md) for further information.

## Example posix/linux usage

There is a small standalone example [here](/test/RTSPTestServer.cpp).  You can build it by following [these](/test/README.md) directions.  The usage of the two key classes (CRtspSession and SimStreamer) are very similar to to the ESP32 usage.

## Supporting new camera devices

Supporting new camera devices is quite simple.  See OV2640Streamer for an example and implement streamImage()
by reading a frame from your camera.
